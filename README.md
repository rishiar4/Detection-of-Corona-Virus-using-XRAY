# Detection-of-Corona-Virus-using-XRAY

> This is a **transfer learning** based project where **VGG16** has been used. Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. I have used the same to detect the possibility of a person suffering from the Corona Virus.

> This is an end to end python project, written with the help of Flask.

> Corona Virus is a world wide spread virus also stated as a pandemic. It effects the respiratory system of humans. It is a virus which causes many respiratory dieases. The Xray of the chest of a normal and a person suffering is shown below.

> ## Xray of an infected person.

> ### Observations
> The Xray image of an infected person is more whitish than a healthy person's Xray. 

> ## Requirements:
> For Required package/module installation, open the terminal and copy paste below command:
> - pip install requirements.txt

> ## To Execute the code:
> Run the command in your terminal or command prompt.
